# HouseHeatMap
Personal Project


The Plan (Written Nov 7th, 2019):

The goal of this project is to create a live 3D view of the heat dispersion in my house. The project will consist of many temperature sensors placed in various locations inside the house, all connected to a central server. The data will be viewed through a web page. The web page will consist of a 3D model of my house with gradient overlay indicating the temperatures throughout it. (Red means hot, blue is cold).
